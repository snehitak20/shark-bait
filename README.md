## Description

The goal of this project is to ultimately have a webpage that is optimized for search engines, and whose codebase will meet accessibility standards. The codebase will follow semantic HTML elements, have accessible alt attributes, and have a descriptive title. The codebase will also have sequential heading attributes, and follow a logical structure. 

## Installation

For this project, fixes mainly occured in the index.html file. The webiste title was renamed to a more descriptive title that is indicative of the webpage. Tags such as `<section>, <article>, <footer>` were used to replace <div> tags, and helped to create a logical and semantic structure. For images, accessible alt attributes were written. Heading attributes were confirmed to be in sequential order. In the style.css file, comments were written to indicate the various CSS selectors used for this project. 

## Usage

To navigate this webpage, click one of the links in the navigation bar that will lead you to the appropriate area of the website.

## Reflection

For this project, I had to learn what is the proper flow of a webpage that follows HTML semantics. I also had to learn to use which HTML semantic elements were most appropriate for this project.
